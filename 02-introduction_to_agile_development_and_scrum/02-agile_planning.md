# Planning to be Agile

## Destination Unknown

**Deadlines:**

I love deadlines… I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.
>— Douglas Adams

- How do you avoid this?

**Plan iteratively:**

- Don’t decide everything at the point when you know the least
- Plan for what you know
- Adjust as you know more
- Your estimates will be more accurate

## Agile Roles and the Need for Training

**Formulas for failure:**

- Product manager becomes product owner
- Project manager becomes scrum master
- Developers (alone) become scrum team

**Product Manager vs. Product Owner:**

“Until and unless business leaders accept the idea that they are no longer managing projects with fixed functions, timeframes, and costs, as they did with waterfall, they will struggle to use agile as it was designed to be used.”
>— Bob Kantor, Founder Kantor Consulting Group, Inc.

**The roles have changed:**

- You cannot put people in new roles without the proper training and mindset
- This mindset must come down from upper management

## Kanban and Agile Planning Tools

**Agile planning tools:**

- Tools will not make you Agile
- Tools can support your Agile process
- Many Agile planning tools
- **ZenHub** is one of them

**ZenHub:**

- Plug-in to GitHub

- Customizable and integrated with GitHub

**Why use ZenHub?**

- Helps you manage where you are in a project based on GitHub Issues

# User Stories

## Creating Good User Stories

**What is a user story?**

A user story represents a small piece of business value that a team can deliver in an iteration.

**Story contents:**

Stories should contain:
- A brief description of the need and business value
- Any assumptions or details
- The definition of “done”

**Story description:**

- User stories document a persona requesting a function to achieve a goal:

As a `<some role>`
I need `<some function>`
So that `<some benefit>`

**Assumptions and details:**

It’s important to document what you know;
- List any assumptions
- Document any details that may help the developer

**Acceptance criteria:**

- It is critical to document the definition of “done”
- I like to use the Gherkin syntax

Given `<some precondition>`
When `<some event happens>`
Then `<some outcome>`

**Sample Story:**

**Bill Wake’s INVEST:**

- **I**ndependent
- **N**egotiable
- **V**aluable
- **E**stimable
- **S**mall
- **T**estable

**Epic:**

- A big ideas
- A user story that is bigger than a single sprint
- A user story that is too big to estimate on its own

**When to use an epic?**

- When a story is too large in scope it is considered an epic
- Backlog items tend to start as epics when they are lower priority and less defined
- For sprint planning, epics should be broken down into smaller stories

## Effectively using Story Points
