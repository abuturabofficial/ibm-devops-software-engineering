# Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum

- **> 70%** of organizations have incorporated some Agile approaches. — Project Management Institute
- **28%** more successful using agile than traditional projects. — Price Waterhouse Coopers
- **47%** agile transformations' failure rate. — Forbes
	- #1 reason is inexperience with implementing and integrating the Agile methodology. — VersionOne
- Agile is a mindset that requires culture change.
- It’s hard to learn Agile from just reading a book.
- Recognizing when something is wrong is just as important as knowing how to do something right.

# Introduction to Agile Philosophy

## Agile Principles

**What is Agile?**

Agile is an iterative approach to project management that helps teams be responsive and deliver value to their customers faster

**Agile defining characteristics:**

Agile emphasizes:
- Adaptive planning
- Evolutionary development
- Early delivery
- Continual improvement
- Responsiveness to change

**Agile Manifesto:**

We have come to value:
**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
**Responding to change** over following a plan.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

**Agile Software development:**

- An iterative approach to software development consistent with Agile Manifesto
- Emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and a high level of transparency
- Uses small, co-located, cross-functional, self-organizing teams

**Key takeaway:**

Build what **is** needed, not what **was** planned.

## Methodologies Overview

### Traditional Waterfall Development:

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230517080627.png)

**Problems with waterfall approach:**

- No provisions for changing requirements
- No idea if it works until the end
- Each step ends when the next begins
- Mistakes found in the later stages are more expensive to fix
- There is usually a long time between software releases
- Teams work separately, unaware of their impact on each other
- The people who know the least about the code are deploying it into production

### Extreme Programming (XP)

- In 1996 Kent Beck introduced XP
- Based on an interactive approach to software development
- Intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements
- One of the first Agile method

**Extreme Programming values:**

- Simplicity
- Communication
- Feedback
- Respect
- Courage

### Kanban

**What is Kanban?**

Kanban | 'kanban | noun
(also Kanban system) a Japanese manufacturing system in which the supply of components is regulated through the use of an instruction card sent along the production line.
- An instruction card used in a Kanban system.

Origin
1970s: Japanese, Literally ‘billboard, sign’

**Core principles of Kanban:**

- Visualize the workflow
- Limit work in progress (WIP)
- Manage and enhance the flow
- Make process policies explicit
- Continuously improve

## Working Agile

- Working in small batches
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
- Test Driven Development (TDD) (Gherkin Syntax — Cucumber)
- Pair programming

# Introduction to Scrum Methodology

**Agile and Scrum:**

- Agile is a **philosophy** for doing work (not prescriptive)
- Scrum is a **methodology** for doing work (add process)

## Scrum Overview

Scrum:
- Is a management framework for incremental product development
- Prescribes small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams
- Provides a structure of roles, meeting, rules, and artifacts
- Uses fixed-length iterations called **sprints**
- Has a goal to build a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration
- Easy to Understand – Difficult to master

**Sprint:**

- A sprint is one iteration through the design, code, test, and deploy cycle
- Every sprint should have a goal
- 2 weeks in duration

**Steps in the Scrum process:**

**Agile development is iterative:**

## The 3 Roles of Scrum

**Scrum roles:**

- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Scrum team

1) **Product owner:**

- Represents the stakeholder interests
- Articulates the product vision
- Is the final arbiter of requirements' questions
- Constantly re-prioritizes the product backlog, adjusting any expectations
- Accepts or rejects each product increment
- Decides whether to ship
- Decides whether to continue development

2) **Scrum master:**

If your team is experienced, you might skip this role, but if you have a team new to Scrum, you require an experienced Scrum master.

- Facilitates the Scrum process
- Coaches the team
- Creates an environment to allow the team to be self-organizing
- Shields the team from external interference to keep it “in the zone”
- Helps resolve impediments
- Enforces sprint timeboxes
- Captures empirical data to adjust forecasts
- Has no management authority over the team

3) **Scrum Team:**

- A cross-functional team consisting of
	- Developers
	- Testers
	- Business analysts
	- Domain experts
	- Others
- Self-organizing
	- There are no externally assigned roles
- Self-managing
	- They self-assign their own work
- **Membership:** consists of 7 ± 2 collaborative members
- **Co-located:** most successful when located in one team room, particularly for the first few Sprints
- **Dedicated:** Most successful with long-term, full-time membership
- Negotiates commitments with the product owner – one sprint at a time
- Has autonomy regarding how to reach commitments

## Artifacts, Events, and Benefits

**Scrum Artifacts:**

- Product backlog
- Sprint backlog
- Done increment

**Scrum events:**

- Sprint planning meeting
- Daily Scrum meeting (a.k.a. daily stand-up)
- Sprint
- Sprint review
- Sprint retrospective

**Benefits of Scrum:**

- Higher productivity
- Better product quality
- Reduced time to market
- Increased stakeholders satisfaction
- Better team dynamics
- Happier employees

**Scrum vs. Kanban:**

# Organizing for Success

## Organizational impact of Agile

**Organize for success:**

- Proper organization is critical to success
- Existing teams may need to be reorganized

**Conway’s Law:**

“Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”
>— Melvin Conway, Datamation, 1968

**Examples of Conway’s Law:**

If you ask an organization with four teams to write a compiler
… you will get a 4-pass compiler!

**How teams should be aligned?**

- Teams are loosely coupled, tightly aligned
- Each team has its own mission aligned with the business (like a “mini startup”)
- Teams have end-to-end responsibility for what they build
- The long-term mission is usually around a single business domain

**Autonomy is important:**

- It’s motivating – and motivated people build better stuff
- It’s fast – decisions happen locally in the team
- It minimizes handoffs and waiting, so teams don’t get bogged down

**The Agile dilemma!**

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230517092428.png)

**The entire organization must be Agile:**

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230517092545.png)

**Agile + DevOps = Alignment**

## Mistaking Iterative Development for Agile

The biggest pitfall for companies is that, they think they’re agile, but actually they're just doing an iterative work.

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230517092847.png)

**Agile is not…**

- Agile isn’t a new version of a waterfall, software development life cycle (SDLC), where you do legacy development in sprints
- Agile isn’t just the developers working in each sprint, it involves a cross-functional team
- The Agile Manifesto doesn’t include the term “Agile project management” (and so there are no “project managers” in Agile)
