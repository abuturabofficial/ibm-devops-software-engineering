**Working directory** – A directory on your file system, including its files and subdirectories, that is associated with a git repository.

## Introduction to GitHub

**Background of Git:**

- Large software projects need a way to track and control source code updates
- Linux needs automated source-version control
- Key characteristics include:
	- Strong support for non-linear development
	- Distributed development
	- Compatibility with existing systems and protocols
	- Efficient handling of large projects
	- Cryptographic authentication of history
	- Pluggable merge strategies

**Git Repository Model:**

- What is special about the Git Repository model?
	- Distributed VCS
	- Tracks source code
	- Coordinates among programmers
		- Tracks changes
		- Supports non-linear workflows
	- Created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds

**What is Git?**

- Git is a distributed VCS
	- Tracks changes to content
	- Provides a central point for collaboration
- Git allows for centralized administration
	- Teams have controlled access scope
	- The main branch should always correspond to deployable code
- IBM Cloud is built around open-source tools including Git repositories

### GitHub

- GitHub is an online hosting service for Git repositories
	- Hosted by a subsidiary of Microsoft
	- Offers free, professional, and enterprise accounts
	- Till 2022, it had over 100M repos
 - What is a Repository?
	 - A data structure for strong documents including application source code
	 - A repository can track and maintain version-control

### GitLab

GitLab is:
- A DevOps platform, delivered as a single application
- Provides access to Git repositories
- Provides source code management

GitLab enables developers to:
- Collaborate
- Work from a local copy
- Branch and merge code
- Streamline testing and delivery with CI/CD
