# Introduction to Development

## Overview of Web and Cloud Development

**Cloud Applications**

- Built to work seamlessly with a Cloud-based back-end infrastructure
- Cloud-based data storage and data processing, and other Cloud services, making them scalable and resilient

**Building websites and cloud applications:**

The environment is divided into two primary areas:

1) **Front-End**

- Deals with everything that happens at the client-side
- Specializes in front-end coding, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related frameworks, libraries, and tools

2) **Back-End**

- Deals with the server before the code and data are sent to the client
- Handles the logic and functionality and the authentication processes that keep data secure
- Back-end developers may also work with relational or NoSQL databases

Full-stack developers have skills, knowledge, and experience in both front-end and back-end environments.

**Developers Tools:**

- Code editor
- IDE

## Learning Front-End Development

- HTML is used to create the structure and CSS is used to design it and make it appealing
- CSS is also used to create websites that have cross browser compatibility such as PC, mobiles devices etc.
- JS adds interactivity

**A front-end development language is Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS)**

- An extension of CSS that is compatible with all versions of CSS.
- SASS enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports to keep things organized.
- SASS allows you to create style sheets faster and more easily.

**Learner Style Sheets (LESS)**

- LESS enhances CSS, adding more styles and functions.
- It is backwards compatible with CSS.
- Less.js is a JS tool that converts the LESS styles to CSS styles.

**Websites are designed as reactive and responsive**

- Reactive or adaptive websites display the version of the website designed for a specific screen size.
- A website can provide more information if opened on a PC than when opened on a mobile device.
- Responsive design of a website means that it will automatically resize to the device.
- If you open up a products' website on your mobile device, it will adapt itself to the small size of the screen and still show you all the features.

**JavaScript frameworks:**

Angular Framework:
- an open-source framework maintained by google
- Allows websites to render HTML pages quickly and efficiently
- Tools for routing and form validation

React.js:
- Developed and maintained by Meta
- It is a JS library that builds and renders components for a web page
- Routing is not a part of this framework and will need to be added using a third-party tool

Vue.js:
- maintained by the community and its main focus is the view layer which includes UI, buttons, visual components
- Flexible, scalable, and integrates well with other frameworks
- Very adaptable – it can be a library, or it can be the framework

**The task of a front-end developer evolves continuously.**

- The technologies are upgraded constantly, and so the front-end developers need to keep upgrading the websites that they create.
- The websites that they create should work in multiple browsers, multiple operating systems, and multiple devices.

## The importance of Back-End Development

- Creates and manages resources needed to respond to client requests
- Enables server infrastructure to process request, supply data and provide other services securely

**What does the back-end developer do?**

- Process the data you enter while browsing, such as:
	- Login information
	- Product searches
	- Payment information
- Write and maintain the parts of the application that process the inputs

**Back-End Developer skills:**

Examples of tasks and associated skills that back-end developers need:

**APIs, routing, and endpoints:**

- APIs, routes, and endpoints process requests from the Front-End
	- API is a code that works with data
	- Routes is a path to a website or page
	- Endpoint can be an API or route
- Back-end developers create routes to direct requests to correct service
- APIs provide a way for Cloud Apps to access resources from the back-end

**Back-end languages and frameworks:**

Some popular back-end languages are:

- JavaScript
	- Node.js
	- Express
- Python
	- Django
	- Flask

**Working with databases:**

Languages and tools for working with databases:
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

# Tools in Software Development

## Introducing Application Development Tools

A cloud application developer’s workbench includes:
- Version Control
- Libraries
	- Collection of reusable code
	- Multiple code libs can be integrated into a project
	- Call from your code when required
	- Used to solve a specific problem or add a specific feature

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230522074609.png)

**Frameworks:**

- Provide a standard way to build and deploy applications
- Act as a skeleton you extend by adding your own code
- Dictate the architecture of the app
- Call your code
- Allow you less control than libs

**Inversion of Control:**

- Libs allow you to call functions as when required
- Frameworks define the workflow that you must follow
- Inversion of control makes the framework extensible

**More tools:**

- CI/CD
- Build tools
	- Transform source code into binaries for installation
	- Important in environments with many interconnected projects and multiple developers
	- Automate tasks like
		- Downloading dependencies
		- Compiling source code into binary code
		- Packaging that binary code
		- Running Tests
		- Deployment to production systems

Examples of Build Tools:

**Packages:**

- Packages make apps easy to install
- Packages contain
	- App files
	- Instructions for installation
	- Metadata

Package managers:
- Make working with packages easier
- Coordinate with file archives to extract package archives
- Verify checksums and digital certificates to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the package
- Locate, download, install, or update existing software from a software repository
- Manage dependencies to ensure a package is installed with all packages it requires

Package Managers by platform:

## Introduction to Software Stacks

**What is a software stack?**

- Combination of technologies
- Used for creating applications and solutions
- Stacked in a hierarchy to support the application from user to computer hardware
- Typically include;
	- Front-end technologies
	- Back-end technologies

**Parts of the software stack:**

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230522081540.png)

**Examples of software stack:**

- Python-Django
- Ruby on Rails
- ASP .NET
- LAMP
- MEAN
- MEVN
- MERN

**LAMP Stack:**

**MEAN and relasted stacks:**

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230522081844.png)

**Comparison of MEAN, MEVN, and LAMP:**

- MEAN
	- All parts use JS – one language to learn
	- Lost of documentation and reusable code
	- Not suited to large-scale applications or relational data
- MEVN
	- Similar to MEAN
	- Less reusable libs
- LAMP
	- Lots of reusable code and support
	- Only on Linux
	- Not suited in non-relational data
	- Uses different languages
