# Introduction to DevOps


## Course Introduction

-   DevOps is a cultural transformation.
-   DevOps is not a tool or a job title. It is a shared mindset.
-   Embrace the DevOps Culture

### How to change a Culture

-   Think Differently
    -   Social Coding
    
    -   Work in small batches
    
    -   Minimum viable product

-   Work Differently
    
    Team culture makes a large difference to a team&rsquo;s ability to deliver software and meet or exceed their organizational goals.

-   Organize Differently

-   Measure Differently
    -   Measures what matters
    
    -   You get what you measure

## Business Case For DevOps

Disruptive Business model:

-   When disruption happen businesses need to adopt according no matter what, and this adaptation should be agile and lean.

Digitization + Business Model:

-   Technology is the enabler of innovation not the driver of innovation.
-   The Businesses, who adapt to new tech, survive.
-   The refusal to change according to the digital ages makes to susceptible to bankruptcy.

## DevOps Adoption

### Unlearn what you have Learned

-   A different mindset
-   Unlearn your current culture
-   Often easier said than done

### Consider this:

-   fail fast and roll back quickly
-   test in market instead of analyzing
-   modular design which makes individual components replaceable

## Definition of DevOps

The term (development and operations) is an extension of agile development environments that aims to enhance the process of software delivery as a whole.&rdquo;
                                                   -Patrick Debois, 2009

### DevOps defined:

-   Recognition that working in silos doesn't work
-   Development and operations engineers working together
-   Following lean and agile principles
-   Delivering software in a rapid and continuous manner

### DevOps requires:

-   A change in culture
-   A new application design
-   Leveraging automation
-   Programmable platform

### What DevOps not:

-   Not simply combining development and operations
-   Not a separate team
-   Not a tool
-   Not one size fits all
-   Not just automation

## Essential Characteristics of DevOps


### What's the Goal?

Agility is the goal:

-   Smart experimentation
-   Moving in market
-   With maximum velocity and minimum risk
-   Gaining quick, valuable insights

### Agility: The Three pillars

1.  1) DevOps:

    -   Cultural change
    -   Automated pipeline
    -   infrastructure as code
    -   immutable infrastructure

2.  2) Microservices:

    -   Loose coupling/binding
    -   RESTful APIs
    -   Designed to resist failures
    -   Test by breaking/fail fast

3.  3) Containers

    -   portability
    -   Developer centric
    -   Ecosystem enabler
    -   Fast startup


### The Perfect Combination

-   DevOps for speed and agility
-   Microservices for small deployments
-   Containers for ephemeral runtimes

### Application Evolution

**Delivery**: waterfall &#x2014;> agile &#x2014;> DevOps

**Architecture**: monoliths &#x2014;> SOA &#x2014;> Microservices

**Infrastructure**: physical servers &#x2014;> Virtual Machines &#x2014;> Containers

### How to change a Culture?

-   change thinking patterns of people
-   working methodology as well as environment
-   organizational change
-   change of the way people are measured

## Leading Up to DevOps


### Traditional Waterfall Method

Requirements &#x2014;> Design &#x2014;> Code &#x2014;> Integration &#x2014;> Test &#x2014;> Deploy


### Problems with Waterfall Approach

-   No room for change
-   No idea if it works till end
-   Each step ends when the next begins
-   Mistakes found in the later stages are more expensive to fix
-   Long time between software releases
-   Team work separately with no knowledge of each other
-   Least familiar people with the code are deploying it

## XP, Agile, and Beyond

-   In 1996, Kent Beck introduced Extreme Programming
-   Based on an interactive approach
-   Intended improve software quality, responsiveness to changing customer requirements

### The Agile Manifesto

We have come to value:

-   **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
-   **Working Software** over comprehensive docs
-   **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
-   **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
