# Introduction to DevOps


## Course Introduction

- DevOps is a cultural transformation.
- DevOps is not a tool or a job title. It is a shared mindset.
- Embrace the DevOps Culture.
- #1 reason why DevOps fails is due to issues around organizational learning and cultural change.
- DevOps is not a tool or a job title. It is a shared mindset.

> “Tools are not the solution to a cultural problem.” — Gartner

> “Team culture makes a large difference to a team’s ability to deliver software and meet or exceed their organizational goals.” — Accelerate State of DevOps 2021

### How to change a Culture

- Think Differently
    - Social Coding
    
    - Work in small batches
    
    - Minimum viable product

- Work Differently
    
    Team culture makes a large difference to a team's ability to deliver software and meet or exceed their organizational goals.

- Organize Differently

- Measure Differently
    - Measure what matters
    
    - You get what you measure

## Business Case For DevOps

**Disruptive Business model:**

- 52% of the Fortune 500 have disappeared since the year 2000.
- When disruption happen, businesses need to adopt according no matter what, and this adaptation should be agile and lean.

**Digitization + Business Model:**

- Technology is the enabler of innovation, not the driver of innovation.
- The Businesses, who adapt to new tech, survive.
- The refusal to change according to the digital ages makes it susceptible to bankruptcy.

## DevOps Adoption

### Unlearn what you have Learned

- A different mindset
- Unlearn your current culture
- Often easier said than done

### Consider this:

- fail fast and roll back quickly
- test in market instead of analyzing
- modular design which makes individual components replaceable

### 2016 DevOps Enterprise Summit

#### How are they doing this?

- What is their secret?
- They have embraced the DevOps culture.

## Definition of DevOps

>The term (development and operations) is an extension of agile development environments that aims to enhance the process of software delivery as a whole.
— Patrick Debois, 2009

### DevOps defined:

- Recognition that working in silos doesn't work
- Development and operations engineers working together
- Following lean and agile principles
- Delivering software in a rapid and continuous manner

### DevOps requires:

- A change in culture
- A new application design
- Leveraging automation
- Programmable platform

### What DevOps not:

- Not simply combining development and operations
- Not a separate team
- Not a tool
- Not one size fits all
- Not just automation

## Essential Characteristics of DevOps


### What's the Goal?

Agility is the goal:

- Smart experimentation
- Moving in market
- With maximum velocity and minimum risk
- Gaining quick, valuable insights

### Agility: The Three pillars

1. DevOps:

    - Cultural change
    - Automated pipeline
    - infrastructure as code
    - immutable infrastructure

2. Microservices:

    - Loose coupling/binding
    - RESTful APIs
    - Designed to resist failures
    - Test by breaking/fail fast

3. Containers

    - portability
    - Developer centric
    - Ecosystem enabler
    - Fast startup

### The Perfect Combination/Storm

- DevOps for speed and agility
- Microservices for small deployments
- Containers for ephemeral runtimes

### Learning how to work differently

> “DevOps starts with learning how to **work differently**. It embraces cross-functional teams with **openness, transparency, and respect** as pillars.”
— Tony Stafford, Shadow Soft.

### Application Evolution

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230509081303.png)

**DevOps has three dimensions:**

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230509081426.png)

**Responsibility, transparency, feedback:**

>“Culture is the #1 success factor in DevOps. Building a culture of **shared responsibility, transparency, and faster feedback** is the foundation of every high-performing DevOps team.”
— Atlassian

**Culture, culture, culture:**

While tools and methods are important;
… it’s the **culture** that has the biggest impact.

### How to change a Culture?

-Change thinking patterns of people
- working methodology as well as environment
- Organizational change.
- Change of the way people are measured.

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230509081809.png)

## Leading Up to DevOps

- Architects worked for months designing the system.
- Development worked for months on features.
- Testing opened defects and sent the code back to development.
- At some point, the code is released to operations.
- The operations team took forever to deploy.

### Traditional Waterfall Method

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230509082531.png)

#### Problems with Waterfall Approach

- No room for change
- No idea if it works till end
- Each step ends when the next begins
- Mistakes found in the later stages are more expensive to fix
- Long time between software releases
- Team work separately, unaware of their impact on each other
- Least familiar people with the code are deploying it into production

## XP, Agile, and Beyond

### Extreme Programming (XP)

- In 1996, Kent Beck introduced Extreme Programming
- Based on an interactive approach to software development
- Intended to improve software quality, responsiveness to changing customer requirements
- One of the first Agile methods

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230509084206.png)

### The Agile Manifesto

We have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working Software** over comprehensive docs
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Agile Development

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230509084310.png)

**Agile alone is not good enough:**

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230509084504.png)

**2 Speed IT:**

- This is how **Shadow IT** started, as Ops team wasn’t meeting their needs.

![](assets/Pasted%20image%2020230509084621.png)

### Shadow IT

- Resources the business doesn’t know about
- People go around IT
- We need the solution to this problem, and DevOps is the answer

## Brief History of DevOps

### Why is the history significant?

It reminds us that DevOps is:
- From the practitioners, by practitioners
- Not a product, specification, or job title
- An experience-based movement
- Decentralized and open to all
